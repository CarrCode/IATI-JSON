# IATI-JSON

[IATI](https://iatistandard.org/en/) is an XML standard humanitarian organizations and donors use to share information about aid activities, transactions and results and make the information openly accessible to machine applications.

For many uses, it's preferable to work with IATI data in **JSON** instead of **XML** and formatted in slightly different ways to suit specific needs. A certain degree of formatting harmonization could serve the humanitarian community and make it easier for developers to build IATI-data-driven applications.

## Project

**IATI-JSON** is a microproject launched to examine IATI's XML structure and model ways of formatting IATI XML into JSON for retrieval and processing by emerging artificial intelligent applications.

## Milestones

Using GitHub [Milestones](https://github.com/Humanitarian-AI/IATI-JSON/milestones) as goals, the microproject will:

* Generate a host of different formatting models for discussion and testing
* Attempt to identify a model best suited for AI applications

Insight gained will be of use to other microprojects like [IATI-Neo4j](https://github.com/Humanitarian-AI/IATI-Neo4j) which looks at how IATI data can be formatted for storage in a graph database and [HXS-API](https://github.com/Humanitarian-AI/HXS-API) which will try to setup an enterprise grade IATI API suitable for powering prototype AI applications.
