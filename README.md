# IATI-JSON

IATI is an XML standard humanitarian organizations and donors use to share information on aid activities, transactions and results and make the information openly accessible to machine applications.

For many applications, users prefer to work with IATI data formatted in JSON instead of XML. And they adapt their formatting in slightly different ways to suit their needs. A certain degree of formatting harmonization could serve the humanitarian community and make it easier for developers to build enterprise grade IATI-data-driven applications.

## Project

This micro-project will examine IATI's XML structure and model ways of ideally formatting IATI XML into JSON for retrieval and processing by emerging artificial intelligent applications.

## Outputs

The microproject will generate IATI JSON formatting models for discussion and testing.

Insight gained will also be of use to other microprojects like [IATI-Neo4j]() which looks at how IATI data can be best formatted for storage in a graph database and [HXS-API]() which looks at how IATI data can be reliably served to enterprise grade applications.
